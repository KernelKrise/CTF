We have Matrix_Lab_2.exe file (https://github.com/project-sekai-ctf/sekaictf-2022/tree/main/reverse/matrix-lab-2/challenge)
This is compiled python file (look at "strings" output)
So, we need to use pyinstxtractor (https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor)

Next, we need to decompile .pyc file. Use https://www.toolnb.com/tools-lang-en/pyc.html to do it.

At the end, reverse the resulting code (solve.py)
